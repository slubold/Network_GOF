This repository contains the code to reproduce the figures in the paper "Spectral goodness of fit tests for complete and partial network data." There are t folders in this repository. 

1) "sim_in_paper": In this folder, we give the code to reproduce the results for the following models: 
 - Beta model
 - Latent space model
 - Directed Erdos-Renyi model 
 - Exponential random graph model
 - Aggregated Relational data model
 
 2) "additional_sim": 
 - Degree-corrected stochastic block model 
 - Comparing the Erdos-Renyi model, stochastic block model, and beta-model.

3) "Real_data_analysis": Analyzed data sets and error function
- Political Blog data
- Simmons College data
- Caltech data
