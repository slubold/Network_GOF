This repository contains the code to reproduce the figures in the paper "Spectral goodness of fit tests for complete and partial network data." There are two folders in this repository. 

1) "Paper_Simulations": In this folder, we give the code to reproduce the results for the following models: 
 - Beta model
 - Latent space model
 - Directed Erdos-Renyi model 
 - Exponential random graph model
 - Aggregated Relational data model
 
 2) "Other_Simulations": 
 - Degree-corrected stochastic block model 
 - Comparing the Erdos-Renyi model, stochastic block model, and beta-model.
